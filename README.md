## Running the Lomi Crowdfund Site

### 1. **Connect Your Wallet**

To interact with the dApp, you need a cryptocurrency wallet. If you don't have one, follow these steps to create and connect it:

**a. Install a Wallet Extension**

 **MetaMask** (recommended) is a popular choice. Download and install the MetaMask extension for your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) from [MetaMask’s official website](https://metamask.io/download.html).

**b. Create a Wallet (if you don’t have one)**

1. Open the wallet extension you installed.
2. Follow the instructions to create a new wallet:
   - Set up a strong password.
   - Securely back up your seed phrase (recovery phrase) and store it in a safe place. This is crucial for recovering your wallet.

**c. Connect Wallet to the dApp**

1. Open the NFT Student Rewards site in your browser.
2. Click on the “Connect Wallet” button usually found in the top right corner of the site.
3. Select your wallet from the list (e.g., MetaMask).
4. Authorize the connection if prompted.

### 2. **Configure Your Network**

Ensure you are connected to the correct blockchain network that your dApp is using. 

**For MetaMask:**

1. Click on the MetaMask extension icon.
2. In the network dropdown (top center), select the network your dApp is deployed on (e.g., Arbitrum Orbit).
3. If the network is not listed, add it manually by entering the network details provided by your dApp or project.

### 3. **Troubleshooting**

**a. Wallet Not Connecting**

- Ensure that you have the correct network selected in your wallet.
- Refresh the page and try connecting again.
- Check for any browser extensions or settings that might block the connection.

**b. Transactions Not Showing**

- Ensure that your wallet has enough funds to cover transaction fees (gas fees).
- Check the transaction history in your wallet or the blockchain explorer for the network you are using.
